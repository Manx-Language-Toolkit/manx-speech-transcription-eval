# Speech Transcription Evaluation Sets for Manx

These evaluation sets are collections of Manx Gaelic speech recordings, along with transcripts (written versions of what is spoken) and, where available, English translations. By providing this data, we hope to support researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts who want to improve tools and technologies related to the Manx language.

**Manx**  
Manx Gaelic (Gaelg) is a Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. After experiencing a period of decline in recent centuries, the language benefited from community-led revitalisation effrots, and now continues to grow through educational programs, community events, and media.

## Why Make Evaluation Sets?

As language technology becomes more advanced, having data to train and test new tools is crucial. Manx language resources are extremely rare compared to most languages, so these sets are important for:

- **Testing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):**  
  Assess and refine tools that convert spoken Manx into written text.

- **Improving Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
  Develop natural, fluent Manx voices, making the language more accessible.

- **Advancing Speech-to-Text (S2T) and Machine Translation (MT):**  
  Help machines understand and accurately translate spoken or written Manx.

- **Developing Spoken Language Identification (SpokenLID):**  
  Teach systems to recognize Manx, even in mixed-language audio.

## Overview of the Evaluation Sets

We have grouped our resources into four main sets. Each set focuses on a different style of Manx speech. For more details, visit each set’s README:

1. **"Loayrt Rish" (Conversations With)**

2. **"Skeelyan Vannin" (Stories of Mann)**  
   [Skeealyn Vannin (Stories of Mann)](./skeealyn_vannin/README.md)

4. **"Ynsaghey" (Learn)**

## How to Use These Sets

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**  
   Visit this repository to access instructions, transcripts, and links to the audio resources.

2. **Integrate Into Your Tools and Models:**  
   Use the transcripts and audio files as training or test data for your language models and speech systems.

3. **Evaluate and Improve:**  
   Test your tools on these datasets and iterate. Over time, you should see improvements in accuracy and fluency of your Manx language models.
